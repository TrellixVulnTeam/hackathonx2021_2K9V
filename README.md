## Inspiration
We were inspired by the "swiping" design from Tinder and decided to build a web app that is similar to Tinder where you can "swipe" through artifacts. We integrated a "create a course" for people (like teachers) who want to create a predetermined sequence of artifacts to show others. We also added a discussion forum where users can ask/talk about the artifact

## What it does
It displays various museum artifacts with a small description one at a time. Users can log in to save the artifact in their "collection", join the discussion page for the artifact, or view other artifacts. Users can also create a predetermined sequence of artifacts that they want to show to others (which we call a "course"). The web app will generate a code that represents the course and anyone with the code will be able to visit/follow the sequence of artifacts.

## How we built it
We used Django and python for the backend and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend with a bit of node/SCSS for styling

## Challenges we ran into
- Getting everyone to understand the same idea/design for the UI/UX
- Figuring out how to get a specific sequence when the user inputs a code
- Designing the databases
- Making the web app dynamic without using a frontend framework

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Getting the project working
- Building a fully-fledged web app
- Designing the database

## What we learned
- How to sleep for only 4h
- Got better at using git
- Passing data from frontend to backend on the same page
- Using JS to make webapp dynamic

## What's next for Artifact Explore
We can probably use AI to create recommendations for what artifact the user sees next. We can also improve on the UX/UI for the discussion and artifact pages
